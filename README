Steps for building Quest:

1) Set your PATH to include $HOME/bin/cross/bin as this is where the
toolchain is installed by default.

2) Run ./install-toolchain.  This takes an optional parameter which is
the number parallel builds you want to use in the build process (the
number for the make -j parameter).  On some machines two large of a
number will actually slow the build processes down to a halt.  If no
parameter is specified it defaults to 1.  install-toolchain will build
binutils, a compiler, and libc (since part of it is needed to finish
the compiler build).

3) Run make.  This will build the kernel and all user level programs.


See kernel/README for instructions on building the kernel specifically.
