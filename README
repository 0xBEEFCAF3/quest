Steps for building Quest (See the toolchain Quest white paper for more
information about the toolchain and libc build):

1) Make sure you have the necessary versions of GMP MPFR and MPC.  If
you are on a 64 bit machine you will most likely need the 32 bit
version of these.  If you do not have the correct versions the build
processes will fail in the beginning.  It is recommended to run
uninstall-toolchain if it fails just as a precaution (although it
probably isn't needed).

2) Set your PATH to include $HOME/bin/cross/bin as this is where the
toolchain is installed by default.  If you wish to change this you
must change the variable TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL_DIR (default value of
$HOME/bin/cross) in both the config.mk in this directory and in
toolchain/Makefile.

3) Run ./install-toolchain.  This takes an optional parameter which is
the number parallel builds you want to use in the build process (the
number for the make -j parameter).  On some machines too large of a
number will actually slow the build processes down to a halt.  If no
parameter is specified it defaults to 1.  install-toolchain will build
binutils, a compiler, and libc (since part of it is needed to finish
the compiler build).

4) Run make.  This will build the kernel and all user level programs.


See kernel/README for instructions on building the kernel
specifically.
