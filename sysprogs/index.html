        <p>Quest is a small operating system designed to be used as the
          basis for research and education. Richard West and Gary Wong
          developed the beginning of Quest in the summer of 2005. Since
          that time, several others such as Matt Danish and Ye Li have
          contributed to developments, including SMP support and
          extended driver development.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Quest is open source software available under the terms of

        <h1>Why a New OS?</h1>
        Given the current state-of-the-art in OS development, and the
        numerous systems already available, this is a natural question
        to ask. In particular, writing a new OS is time-consuming, and
        technically difficult. It is unlikely that without many
        man-years of development a new OS will ever have the maturity to
        support commercial-grade applications, partly due to the lack of
        driver support and rich APIs/libraries on which such
        applications depend. However, from our experience the code
        complexity of existing modern systems often becomes a hindrance
        when developing new policies and mechanisms. Similarly, many
        pre-existing systems have evolved from designs that are
        fundamentally based on principles from several decades ago, yet
        in that time there have been significant hardware changes. We
        now have multicore processors with hardware virtualization
        support, simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), shared on-chip
        caches, NUMA topologies with on-chip integrated memory
        controllers and interconnection networks, and power management
        features. It is true that many modern OSes have evolved to
        support these new hardware features but there is evidence to
        suggest a new approach is worthwhile considering e.g., due to
        scalability concerns associated with the management of many
        on-chip cores, and also the micro-architectural resource
        contention due to the inherent parallel access to caches, bus
        interconnects and memory. <br>
        <br>
        With this in mind, Quest is a new OS that aims to support "time
        as a first-class resource". From the ground up, Quest manages
        all resources via time-budgeted and temporally-isolated virtual
        CPUs (VCPUs). The system features a hierarchical scheduling
        infrastructure, with both main and IO VCPUs to handle the
        execution of conventional tasks and system events associated
        with interrupts.&nbsp; This means that real-time and
        non-real-time tasks can co-exist without interference, at least
        in terms of the resource time budgets they are guaranteed. This
        does not, however, guarantee the amount of progress a task makes
        in real-time, because micro-architectural resource contention is
        still possible. For example, one task may evict another's memory
        contents from a shared on-chip cache, or may compete for memory
        bus bandwidth. These factors all affect the execution time of
        tasks. <br>
        <br>
        To ensure efficient progress is made by all tasks, and to try to
        bound the amount of interference between tasks caused by
        micro-architectural resource contention, Quest incorporates a
        real-time performance monitoring sub-system that uses hardware
        performance counters to track micro-architectural resource
        usage. From this, we are able to construct performance curves
        and various resource usage models, including predictions of
        cache occupancy and the effect this will have on task execution.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from predictability and efficiency objectives, Quest also
        aims to ensure its integrity is not compromised by ill-written
        or malicious third party software. This aspect of safety is to
        prevent system failure when any sub-component behaves
        erroneously. In this regard, Quest utilizes various hardware and
        software features (including hardware virtualization) to isolate
        system components, so that if one component fails the system can
        recover. <br>

        <h1>Reference Development Platform</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>While Quest will work on most x86 platforms with the right
            driver support, the hardware virtualization capabilities
            currently used for enhanced system safety require Intel
            processors with the following hardware flags (as reported
            under Linux via /proc/cpuinfo): vmx, ept, mtrr. Given our
            manpower resources, we have focused on Intel
            hardware-virtualization but AMD support wil be added in the
            future. This means you will need a multicore processor such
            as a Sandybridge, with extended page tables and memory type
            range registers. <br>
          </li>
          <li>To boot Quest we recommend using a motherboard with a
            PXE-compliant BIOS for network boots. Similarly, a
            motherboard with a built-in serial device (16550A-compatible
            UART or a PCI/PCIe slotcard) is recommended for serial
            debugging. <br>
          </li>
          <li>The following is a recommended base system:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Intel "Sandybridge" Core i3 2100 LGA 1155 3.1 GHz
              processor (alternatively, i5, i7 will do)</li>
            <li>LGA 1155 motherboard. A Gigabyte GA-H67N-USB3-B3
              mini-ITX board is quite nice if you desire a small
              form-factor. The ASRock Pro3-M mATX is slightly larger
              but another excellent board.</li>
            <li>NOTE: For the motherboard, it is desirable to have
              either the Z68 or H67 Intel chipset. These chipsets both
              support integrated graphics on the Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs. You
              also want a motherboard with a Realtek 8168/8111E
              integrated network chip. It is desirable but not required
              to have an RS232 serial header on the board, as well as
              PS/2 keyboard connectivity and a traditional PCI slot. The
              ASRock board above has all this, but is hard to find. 
	      The Gigabyte board is a mini-ITX small form-factor board.
              It lacks the serial header and PS/2 but this is not critical 
	      if you get a serial PCI-express card.</li>
