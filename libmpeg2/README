libmpeg2 is created by extracting and then patching the configuration
files as necessary, running ./configure specifying the $(TARGET) as
the host and other necessary configure script parameters (see the
Makefile for all of them).  This is all done via a call to make all.
Because make all will run the libmpeg2-$(VERSION) make and make
install to keep the build process fast and since libmpeg2-$(VERSION)
should never be changed a file called make_guard is created once the 
archive files have been installed.  If this file exists make all
will not invoke the libmpeg2-$(VERSION) make.  Doing a make clean or
make cleanall will remove this file.  Also if the libmpeg2.patch file
is modified in any way the archive files are removed and the build is
remade from scratch.
