libmpeg2 is created by extracting and then patching the configuration
files as necessary, running ./configure specifying the $(TARGET) as
the host and other necessary configure script parameters (see the
Makefile for all of them).  This is all done via a call to make all.
Because make all will run the libmpeg2 make and make install and make
install will install numerous headers and archive files a file called
make_guard is created once the archive files have been installed.  If
any files in libmpeg2 have a newer timestamp than make_guard the
libmpeg2 make all and make install are run again.  Doing a make clean
or make cleanall will remove this file.  Also if the libmpeg2.patch
file is modified in any way the archive files are removed and the
build is remade from scratch.
