A few notes about our newlib port:

To get newlib to build it needs the standard header files that a
compiler typically provides.  However since we are using gcc and do
not include any of the default, our solution is to grab all the
compiler header files.

To make building other programs easier all the include files for
everything (the compiler, newlib and quest's libc specifics) have
symbol links in ./include.  Therefore user level programs just need to
link to ./include and everything is good.  Slight problem with this is
that newlib and the gcc include files have some overlap, specifically
limits.h and stdint.h.  We choose to use limits.h and stdint.h from
newlib.
